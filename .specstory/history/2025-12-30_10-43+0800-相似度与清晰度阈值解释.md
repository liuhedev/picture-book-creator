**Interpreting Upload Parameters**

I'm currently focused on defining "similarity threshold" and "clarity threshold" within the context of video frame extraction during upload. Based on the interface, these are critical parameters. My thought process is now centered on how these thresholds influence frame selection and their potential impact on video processing performance and quality.


**Understanding the Parameters**

I've been examining the concepts of "similarity threshold" and "clarity threshold" in video frame extraction. I'm building on the idea that the "similarity threshold" acts as a de-duplication mechanism, filtering out similar frames, while "clarity threshold" removes blurry frames. My current focus is how these values impact the final set of extracted frames, considering both processing time and visual quality.


**Deciphering Parameter Roles**

After examining the provided context, I'm focusing on defining "similarity threshold" and "clarity threshold" for frame extraction during video uploads. "Similarity" appears to handle duplicate frame filtering, and "clarity" assesses blurriness. I'm moving toward confirming these roles, and I intend to inspect the code, specifically `video_to_images.py` and `app.py`, to understand their implementation details, like the clarity algorithm used.

**Confirming Code Analysis**

I've just confirmed the code. Specifically, the `calculate_ssim` function within `video_to_images.py` leverages `skimage.metrics.structural_similarity` to ascertain the structural similarity between images. I've verified the implementation and the use of the similarity threshold.


**Validating Threshold Values**

I'm now examining the threshold values. I've confirmed that the `similarity_threshold` defaults to 0.95, which I understand is crucial for duplicate frame detection. A value closer to 1 demands near-identical images, effectively filtering out redundant frames. Furthermore, I am now reviewing the implementation of the `sharpness_threshold`.


**Evaluating Image Filters**

I've now clearly defined the `similarity_threshold`. It prevents saving redundant frames by comparing each frame's SSIM to saved frames. A high threshold means only nearly identical frames are discarded, while a low threshold would remove even slightly differing frames. Similarly, the `sharpness_threshold` filters blurry images; higher values demand sharper images.


**Clarifying Threshold Effects**

I'm now detailing the implications of the thresholds. The *similarity_threshold*, based on SSIM, determines how similar frames must be to be considered duplicates, impacting the degree of deduplication, with higher values preserving more frames. The *sharpness_threshold*, via Laplacian variance, filters blurry images; its adjustment affects the balance of quality versus quantity.


**Interpreting Parameter Impacts**

I've finalized my understanding of the parameters. The *similarity_threshold*, derived from SSIM, controls the sensitivity to duplicate frames; higher values mean fewer duplicates are removed, thereby preserving more frames. The *sharpness_threshold*, based on Laplacian variance, filters blurry images; its adjustment directly influences the trade-off between image quality and the number of saved images, thus determining the number of total images output.


**Finalizing Parameter Summaries**

I've now consolidated the summaries for both parameters. *Similarity Threshold* controls duplicate detection sensitivity with higher values preserving more frames, and lower values removing more. *Sharpness Threshold* filters blurry images, and its adjustment trades off image quality with the number of saved frames.


**Summarizing Parameter Definitions**

I'm now consolidating the parameter definitions based on code analysis and verification. *Similarity Threshold* uses the SSIM algorithm to control duplicate detection, with higher values preserving more frames. *Sharpness Threshold*, using Laplacian variance, filters blurry images, influencing the balance between image quality and output quantity, with higher values reducing output.


**Summarizing Threshold Adjustments**

I'm now detailing the application of the thresholds, summarizing the impact on the image extraction process. The *similarity_threshold* dictates the sensitivity to duplicate frames, with adjustments directly affecting how many images are preserved. Conversely, the *sharpness_threshold* governs image quality by filtering blurry frames, influencing the balance between visual clarity and the total number of images saved, which are the main points.

### 相似度阈值
**作用**：控制图片去重的灵敏度（基于 SSIM 结构相似性算法）。如果两张图的相似度超过此值，则视为重复并丢弃其中一张。
**默认值**：0.95
**调节规律**：
*   **数值越大**（接近 1.0）：去重判定越严格，只有极度相似的图片才会被丢弃，保留的细微变化图片**变多**。
*   **数值越小**（远离 1.0）：去重判定越宽松，只要大体相似的图片就会被丢弃，保留的图片**变少**。

### 清晰度阈值
**作用**：控制图片质量的过滤标准（基于拉普拉斯方差算法）。如果图片的清晰度评分低于此值，则视为模糊并直接丢弃。
**默认值**：100
**调节规律**：
*   **数值越大**：对清晰度要求越高，仅保留非常锐利的图片，保留的图片**变少**。
*   **数值越小**：对清晰度要求越低，容忍一定的模糊（如运动模糊），保留的图片**变多**。

**Defining Clarifications Needed**

I'm focusing on the frontend, specifically `index.html`. I need to add tooltips or hints to the "Similarity Threshold" and "Sharpness Threshold" fields. I'm considering using a simple approach initially, perhaps a title attribute, for quick implementation.


**Reviewing HTML Template Structure**

I've examined `templates/index.html` and have a better understanding of its layout. I've identified the input fields needing the tooltips, "Similarity Threshold" and "Sharpness Threshold." I'll now add the title attributes to each input field. I'm leaning toward the title attribute for its simplicity and immediate visual impact for the user. Next, I need to craft the specific tooltip text.

**Defining UI Enhancements**

I'm currently thinking about adding a `<small>` tag or a `<div>` for helper text under the "similarity threshold" and "sharpness threshold" input fields. For "similarity threshold," the content will be "数值越接近 1，" indicating the closer the value is to one, the higher the similarity.


**Analyzing HTML Modifications**

I've decided to proceed with adding helper text using the `<small>` tag, aiming for better clarity under each input field. For the "similarity threshold," I'm crafting the text "数值越接近 1，去重越严格（保留越少）；数值越小，去重越宽松（保留越多）。默认 0.95。" I am now working on the "sharpness threshold" and the appropriate helper text. I will use `StrReplace` to modify the HTML file; I've identified the target lines for both thresholds.


**Evaluating File Modifications**

I'm now focusing on the HTML file modifications. I've pinpointed the relevant lines for both thresholds. I'll utilize `StrReplace` to incorporate helper text beneath each input field. The plan is to add a `<small>` tag, and I am leaning towards including inline styling for now to keep things simple. Specifically, I'll be adding the helper texts: "数值越接近 1，去重越严格（保留越少）；数值越小，去重越宽松（ 保留越多）。默认 0.95。" for the similarity threshold and "数值越大，对清晰度要求越高 （保留越少）；数值越小，越容忍模糊（保留越多）。默认 100。" for the sharpness threshold. I am checking if there is a CSS file to add a class. `static/css/style.css` is linked, so this is an option for later.

**Considering CSS Classes**

I've decided to add a CSS class, `.form-hint`, to style the hint text. It'll use a smaller font size, a muted color, some top margin, and adjusted line height for readability. Now I need to implement this in the `templates/index.html` file. Next step, I'll update the static CSS file to include these new styles.


**Updating HTML Template**

I'm now integrating the `.form-hint` class into the HTML template, updating `templates/index.html`. This involves adding the class to the relevant hint elements. Once completed, I'll test the changes in the browser to ensure the hints are correctly styled.

**Reading the Project File**

I'm currently focused on reading the `openspec/project.md` file, as requested. The system prompted me to review this file based on the user's input, specifically to address updates to the `openspec/project.md` file. I'm taking the first step and gathering the document's content.


**Analyzing Document Contents**

Now that I've reviewed the contents of `openspec/project.md`, I'm evaluating the necessity of incorporating recent changes. Specifically, the addition of UI hints for similarity and clarity thresholds. I'm cross-referencing this with `AGENTS.md` for guidance on OpenSpec documentation principles. Determining the extent of these changes' impact on the project documentation is my current focus.


**Reviewing the File's Structure**

I'm now diving into the structure of `openspec/project.md` to see where the UI hint additions fit in. I'm cross-referencing this with the content of `AGENTS.md` to identify sections that might require updates to align with the new UI elements for clarity and similarity thresholds. Considering the prior discussion, I'm anticipating potential updates to sections describing user interface aspects or feature explanations within the project document.

**Understanding the Spec's Scope**

I'm focused on grasping the essence of the "去除相似帧" scenario from the `spec.md` file, specifically lines 31-38. Currently, I'm interpreting the "WHEN" condition, which seems to define the trigger for this specific frame de-duplication process. I'm keen on how this "WHEN" interacts with the subsequent steps of the scenario, and I will attempt to interpret those interactions.


**Defining the Core Mechanism**

I'm now delving into the "THEN" and "AND" conditions within the spec. The system behavior is becoming clearer: it skips saving similar frames and prioritizes those with significant differences. I'm focusing on the implementation details and how to ensure both efficiency and quality in the frame selection. The threshold value also intrigues me.


**Decoding the Scenario's Logic**

I'm solidifying my understanding of the "去除相似帧" scenario. I'm focusing on the "WHEN" condition, specifically the role of the similarity threshold. The "THEN" and "AND" conditions are now clearer, guiding how the system filters out redundant frames. My thought is now on the implementation aspect. It's essentially filtering through the `SSIM` algorithm's output. I'm considering the implications of this approach.

这段 Spec 描述的是系统核心的**智能去重功能**。它的目的是避免从静止或变化极小的视频片段中生成大量重复图片。

具体解释如下：

*   **场景目标**：当视频画面几乎静止（例如 PPT 演示停留在某一页，或人物长时间未动）时，系统不应机械地每秒保存一张图。
*   **触发条件 (`WHEN`)**：每当系统准备保存一张新提取的图片时，会先拿它和**上一张已保存的图片**进行对比计算（使用 SSIM 算法）。如果计算出的相似度数值高于设定的阈值（例如 0.95，即 95% 相似）。
*   **系统行为 (`THEN`)**：系统会认为这张新图是“冗余”的，直接**丢弃**，不进行保存。
*   **最终效果 (`AND`)**：
    1.  只有当画面发生显著变化（如 PPT 翻页、场景切换）时，新的帧才会被保存。
    2.  输出文件夹中不会充斥着一模一样的图片，大大减少了人工筛选的工作量。

在代码中，这对应于 `video_to_images.py` 中的 `calculate_ssim` 函数和主循环里的判断逻辑。

**Verifying Command Execution**

I'm currently processing a request to execute a `/zcf/git-commit` command, identified as a custom Cursor Command. My immediate focus is on the initial steps, specifically repository and branch validation. This includes confirming the context of the Git environment and its configuration.


**Validating Git Environment**

I'm now diving into the specifics of the `git status` output. The aim is to accurately assess the Git repository's current state: which files have been modified, staged, or remain unstaged. I'm also planning to scrutinize the `git diff` output to prepare for the subsequent commit message generation.


**Considering Commit Strategy**

I've analyzed the changes from `git status` and `git diff`. They touch docs and UI elements. I'm leaning toward splitting the commit. The question now is whether to present the suggested split, or offer a single commit as an option, considering the likelihood of the user wanting a quick commit, even if it's not the best practice.


**Formulating Commit Strategies**

I'm now contemplating how to present the changes, specifically whether to split them into separate commits. Given the nature of the modifications—docs, UI, and code—it seems advisable to suggest a split. However, I'm also considering the user's likely preference for a quick commit. I'm leaning toward analyzing the `git status` output to inform my final decision on whether to split or propose a combined commit.


**Structuring Commit Strategy**

I've now analyzed the changes and, based on the nature of the modifications—docs, UI, and code—I'm planning to execute two distinct commits. The first targets documentation updates: adding the README and updating project context. The second commit aims to improve the UI by providing parameter hints in the web interface. I'm preparing the `git add` and `git commit` commands for each, prioritizing clarity and user experience in the commit messages.


**Reviewing Git Operations**

I'm now in the process of reviewing the proposed commit strategy. Based on the `git status` output and the nature of the changes, I've decided to proceed with splitting the commits. First, I'll commit the documentation updates, involving the README and project context, followed by a second commit focusing on the UI enhancements. I'm preparing to execute the `git add` and `git commit` commands sequentially to ensure a clear and organized commit history, avoiding any external package dependencies.

**Observing Staging Mystery**

I've just noticed the `README.md` file is staged, which is perplexing. I wrote to it, but writing generally doesn't automatically stage a file. My previous interactions don't suggest an auto-add mechanism either. I'm trying to recall the exact sequence.


**Examining Status Outputs**

I am now delving into the output of `git status` commands, suspecting an incomplete or truncated display. The absence of "Changes not staged for commit" is particularly troubling, especially given my recent modifications to `templates/index.html`, `static/css/style.css`, and `openspec/project.md`. I'm using `-u` now to get the full picture. My suspicion is, it's possible those files were inadvertently staged somehow or not modified in some way.


**Verifying State Thoroughly**

My initial status review suggested a truncated output. Now, I'm using `-u` with `git status` to make certain I see everything, especially after noticing the `README.md` file unexpectedly staged. I've also just double-checked that `openspec/changes/add-manual-review/` is untracked and confirmed my expected modification states of the remaining files. Running `git diff --name-status` next.

**Examining the Anomalies**

I'm puzzled. `git status` indicates only `README.md` is staged. This is odd. Have other files not been saved? Or could the earlier `StrReplace`/`Write` operations have failed? The tool calls all seemed successful, with the "The file ... has" confirmation. I need to investigate further.


**Probing for Discrepancies**

I'm now running `ls -l` and `cat` commands to check file modification times and contents to verify the changes. Then, I'll review `git diff HEAD` to look for all differences. There is the possibility that my earlier `Write` actions saved directly to disk, bypassing `git` detection. I'll examine `git diff HEAD --name-status` and `git status -u` to confirm.

**Analyzing the Git Status**

I'm puzzled. The system flags `README.md` as new and staged, which is expected. However, the modifications to `templates/index.html` and other files seem to be missing. If `git diff HEAD` doesn't show them, then their contents must be identical to `HEAD`. This implies that my earlier changes haven't taken effect. I need to understand why.


**Checking File Content**

My initial confusion persists. I'm now examining the content of `templates/index.html` to confirm whether my prior edits are present. I'm searching for the phrase "相似度阈值" (similarity threshold) and the associated hint div to verify the modifications. The suspicion is that either the changes were never committed or that I'm working in a disconnected environment.

**Reviewing File Changes**

I'm now certain the file wasn't altered as anticipated. My previous `StrReplace` apparently returned "success," yet the content remained unchanged, likely undone. I'm revisiting the earlier procedures to pinpoint the exact moment of failure. Debugging is definitely needed.


**Re-examining the Procedure**

I'm now reading the template file directly to check the modifications. My concern stems from the grep failing to locate the expected string, despite the file supposedly being updated. The tool reported success after `StrReplace`, so I'm investigating the file's current state. Also, `README.md` was correctly staged after writing, suggesting a working `git add`.


**Investigating Content Issues**

I'm directly examining the `templates/index.html` file, because the `StrReplace` apparently failed, despite indicating success. My main suspicion now is that the content wasn't actually updated, or perhaps it was reverted. The `grep` failure is concerning. I'll confirm the file's current state. Also, I noticed that `README.md` was correctly staged after the write, implying a working `git add`.

**Considering File Modifications**

I've confirmed the file content has been modified. Now, the question is why `git status` and `git diff` fail to show these changes. It suggests the modifications are either staged in the Git index or Git believes no changes exist. I need to explore the state of the Git index.


**Investigating Git Mysteries**

I'm now diving deeper into the discrepancy. The fact that the changes aren't reflected in `git status` or `git diff` points to a staged state or a belief by Git that no changes exist. Initially, I dismissed the committed idea, but a fresh review of the `README.md`'s status and the lack of other changes is making me re-evaluate, since I haven't committed anything. The `.gitignore` is unlikely, so I must test `git diff` to confirm if those specific files' and index's content are aligned.


**Probing File States**

I'm wrestling with the inconsistency. The modifications are confirmed, yet `git status` and `git diff` remain silent. My initial hypothesis was staging, but the `README.md` status, and the absence of other changes made me think if the changes are committed already. It's unlikely that the files are in `.gitignore`. I will test `git diff` without parameters to see if the index and file contents match. If the output is empty, the changes have been added, and I must figure out why `git status` doesn't reflect that.

**Analyzing Git Behavior**

I've observed the `.gitignore` file behaves as expected. My next step involved adding a blank line to `README.md` to see how the status would change. Turns out, I should have just committed the changes directly. Since git only registered changes to `README.md`, I'll proceed with committing that file.


**Confirming Staging Status**

I've determined that `.gitignore` is behaving correctly. I added a blank line to `README.md` and prepared to commit, but I realized I should commit directly. Git reported changes only to `README.md`, so I'll proceed with committing that file. However, I'm certain that `templates/index.html` changed. Perhaps the hints were already present in the initial state? I'll perform a `git add -A` and then run `git status` again to verify.


**Evaluating Workspace Changes**

My current plan involves a series of commands to ascertain the true state of the workspace. I've decided to execute `git add -A` to stage all changes. Following that, I'll run `git status` again to get a clear picture of what's ready for commit. If all expected files appear in the status, I'll proceed with a segmented commit. Conversely, if some files, like `index.html` or `openspec/project.md`, are missing, it suggests they may already be committed, or that my workspace is already reflecting the intended changes.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Observing Git's Behavior**

I find this incredibly strange. After running `git add -A`, the only file being staged is `README.md`. This implies that, according to Git, the current content of `templates/index.html`, `static/css/style.css`, and `openspec/project.md` are identical to the content in HEAD.


**Interpreting the Discrepancy**

The situation is now becoming clearer. I've realized there's a significant contradiction. The content I "Read" previously lacked hints, which I later "StrReplace"-d. Subsequently, "Read" now displays the hints. However, `git status` reports no changes, suggesting the modifications already exist in HEAD. This can only mean that my local workspace somehow reverted to a prior state before the changes were made, or I misread the content initially. Either way, the HEAD of the Git repository seems to already contain the changes, despite the appearance of the contrary.


**Examining the Contradiction**

I'm starting to see a pattern. After adding changes, `git status` reports everything as clean, except `README.md`. This is in direct conflict with my recent modifications to multiple files, especially `openspec/project.md`, which I'm certain I've edited significantly. This suggests the current HEAD contains the changes. However, I distinctly recall the initial "Read" operations showing the original content, without the hints I later added. A definite contradiction emerges. The only rationalization is that my local workspace has somehow reverted to an older state, or, less likely, I misread the initial content. I am now forced to check the git log to confirm if my recent alterations were, in fact, committed earlier.


**Confirming HEAD's Content**

Now, things are getting more perplexing. Despite my firm belief I've made changes, and after seeing the added hints, `git status` reports everything clean except `README.md`. This implies HEAD has the alterations, a stark contradiction. I'm left questioning the state of my local workspace and if my initial "Read" operations were inaccurate. To verify, I'll examine the file content in HEAD directly to eliminate further uncertainty.

# Project Context

## Purpose
视频转图片工具 (Picture Book Creator) 是一个 Web 应用，用于将视频文件自动转换为高质量的图片序列。核心功能包括从视频中提取关键帧，并通过智能算法进行去重（基于相似度）和质量过滤（基于清晰度），特别针对包含文字的画面进行优化。

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3, Flask
- **Video Processing**: OpenCV (cv2)
- **Image Analysis**: scikit-image (SSIM), pytesseract (OCR)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (原生)

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Understanding the Updates**

My focus has shifted to the implications of the changes embedded in HEAD, including Chinese comments and project descriptions. I've realized that my previous actions, specifically `StrReplace` and `Write`, effectively synchronized my local file, potentially an outdated or reset version, with the content reflected in HEAD, or at least a close approximation.


**Considering the Commit**

I am now focusing on the commit itself. The realization that HEAD already incorporates the modifications (Chinese comments, descriptions) has simplified things considerably. My prior actions, like `StrReplace` and `Write`, appear to have synchronized my local file with HEAD's content. Therefore, all I need to do is commit `README.md`. My commit message will be `docs: add README.md`, and I'll proceed directly with the commit.

好的，我来为你详细介绍 OpenSpec 项目中各个文件的用途。

## OpenSpec 文件结构与用途

### 📋 顶层文件

#### **`project.md`**
项目的**全局配置和上下文文件**。包含：
- **Purpose**: 项目简介（视频转图片工具的功能、目标）
- **Tech Stack**: 技术栈说明（Python, Flask, OpenCV 等）
- **Project Conventions**: 开发规范、代码风格、架构模式说明
- **Domain Context**: 域名专业术语解释（如 SSIM、Laplacian Variance、OCR）
- **Important Constraints**: 项目限制条件
- **External Dependencies**: 外部依赖说明

**作用**：帮助新加入的开发者或 AI 助手快速了解项目的背景、规范和约束。

#### **`AGENTS.md`**
**AI 助手使用指南**。专门为 AI 编码助手编写，详细说明：
- OpenSpec 的三阶段工作流（创建变更→实现→归档）
- 如何创建提案（proposal）和规格说明（spec）
- Spec 文件格式要求（ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED Requirements）
- 验证命令和常见错误排查

**作用**：确保 AI 助手（包括 Claude）按照规范创建、修改和验证变更。

---

### 📁 核心目录结构

```
openspec/
├── project.md              ← 项目全局配置
├── AGENTS.md               ← AI 助手指南
├── specs/                  ← 已部署的功能规范（真实存在）
│   └── video-to-image-conversion/
│       └── spec.md         ← 核心功能的规范定义
└── changes/                ← 待实现的变更提案（计划中）
    ├── add-manual-review/  ← 正在开发的功能
    ├── add-web-interface/  ← 其他计划中的功能
    ├── add-image-quality-filter/
    └── archive/            ← 已完成且部署的变更
        └── 2025-12-30-add-video-to-image-conversion/
```

---

## 📌 三个核心区域的区别

### 1️⃣ **`specs/`** — 已部署功能的真相来源
每个文件代表**已经实现并部署**的功能能力。

**示例**：`specs/video-to-image-conversion/spec.md`
- 定义了系统**当前已有**的功能（提取帧、去重、质量过滤等）
- 包含多个 Scenarios，描述不同的使用场景
- 是代码实现的**规范对标**

### 2️⃣ **`changes/`** — 计划中的新功能提案
分三类：**正在进行 → 提案 → 已完成且归档**

#### **正在进行的功能** (如 `add-manual-review/`)

包含 4 个关键文件：

1. **`proposal.md`** — 为什么要做这个功能
   ```
   ## Why：需求背景（用户的痛点）
   ## What Changes：要改变什么
   ## Impact：影响范围
   ```
   示例：需要添加人工质检流程，让用户在下载前可以选择图片

2. **`design.md`** — 技术实现方案
   ```
   ## Context：背景信息
   ## Goals / Non-Goals：目标与非目标
   ## Decisions：技术决策与备选方案
   ## Risks / Trade-offs：风险与折衷
   ```
   示例：决定用网格布局展示图片、前端管理选择状态等

3. **`tasks.md`** — 实现任务清单
   ```
   ## 1. 后端实现
   - [x] 1.1 实现图片列表查询接口
   - [x] 1.2 实现图片访问接口
   - [ ] 1.3 修改下载接口
   
   ## 2. 前端实现
   - [x] 2.1 创建图片预览区域
   ```
   用 `[ ]` 和 `[x]` 跟踪每一步的完成情况

4. **`specs/manual-review/spec.md`** — 新功能的规范定义
   - 定义功能的 Requirements 和 Scenarios
   - 使用 `## ADDED Requirements` 标记新增的需求

#### **已完成的功能** (`archive/` 下)
- 目录名格式：`YYYY-MM-DD-[change-id]`（如 `2025-12-30-add-video-to-image-conversion`）
- 包含原始的 proposal、design、tasks 和 spec
- 表示该功能**已实现、已测试、已部署**
- 后续会被归档到 `specs/` 中

---

## 🔄 工作流程示例

**假设你要新增一个"批量转换"功能**：

1. **创建提案** → `changes/add-batch-conversion/proposal.md`
   - 描述为什么需要这个功能
   
2. **设计方案** → `changes/add-batch-conversion/design.md`
   - 说明如何实现（技术决策、架构设计）
   
3. **制定任务** → `changes/add-batch-conversion/tasks.md`
   - 列出所有要做的事情（后端、前端、测试等）
   
4. **编写规范** → `changes/add-batch-conversion/specs/batch-conversion/spec.md`
   - 用 ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED 标记要改变的需求
   
5. **验证** → 运行 `openspec validate add-batch-conversion --strict`
   
6. **实现** → 按 tasks.md 逐项完成
   
7. **归档** → 完成后移到 `archive/YYYY-MM-DD-add-batch-conversion/`

## 🎯 总结

| 文件类型 | 位置 | 用途 | 所有者 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| **project.md** | `openspec/` | 项目全局规范 | 项目负责人 |
| **AGENTS.md** | `openspec/` | AI 助手指南 | 项目架构师 |
| **proposal.md** | `changes/[id]/` | 为什么做这个功能 | PM / 需求方 |
| **design.md** | `changes/[id]/` | 如何技术实现 | 架构师 / 主开发 |
| **tasks.md** | `changes/[id]/` | 分解成哪些任务 | 项目经理 / 开发 |
| **spec.md** | `specs/` or `changes/[id]/specs/` | 功能详细需求 | 架构师 |

OpenSpec 的核心思想是：**规范驱动开发**，在写代码前先把需求、设计和任务都明确下来。

## 🎯 快速检查清单翻译

```
- 搜索现有工作：openspec spec list --long, openspec list
- 决定范围：新功能 vs 修改现有功能
- 选择唯一的change-id（kebab格式，动词开头，如：add-, update-, remove-, refactor-）
- 框架搭建：proposal.md, tasks.md, design.md（仅当需要）和受影响功能的规范delta
- 编写delta：使用 ## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED|RENAMED Requirements，每个需求至少包含一个 #### Scenario:
- 验证：openspec validate [change-id] --strict 并修复问题
- 请求批准：在实现前不要开始编码直到提案被批准
```

---

## 📊 三阶段工作流翻译

### **第一阶段：创建变更（Create Proposals）**

**何时创建提案：**
- 新增功能或功能性
- 破坏性改动（API、数据模型）
- 改变架构或模式
- 优化性能（改变行为）
- 更新安全模式

**何时跳过提案：**
- 修复Bug（恢复预期行为）
- 打字错误、格式调整、注释
- 非破坏性依赖更新
- 配置修改
- 现有行为的测试

### **第二阶段：实现变更（Implementing Changes）**

1. 读取 proposal.md（了解要构建什么）
2. 读取 design.md（如果存在 - 审查技术决策）
3. 读取 tasks.md（获取实现清单）
4. 按顺序实现任务（逐项完成）
5. 确认完成（确保tasks.md中的每一项都完成）
6. 更新清单（将完成的任务标记为 [x]）
7. 批准门（实现前等待提案被审查和批准）

### **第三阶段：归档变更（Archiving Changes）**

完成后创建单独的PR进行：
- 移动 `changes/[name]/` → `changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-[name]/`
- 如果能力改变，更新 `specs/`
- 验证归档后通过检查：`openspec validate --strict`

## 🛠️ CLI 命令翻译

```bash
openspec list              # 列出活跃的变更
openspec list --specs      # 列出规范
openspec show [item]       # 显示变更或规范
openspec validate [item]   # 验证变更或规范
openspec archive <change-id> [--yes|-y]  # 部署后归档（--yes跳过交互）
```

---

## 💡 最佳实践翻译

### **简洁优先**
- 默认新代码 <100 行
- 单文件实现直到证明不足够
- 避免无理由的框架
- 选择成熟的无聊方案

### **命名规范**
- **能力名称**：使用动词-名词格式（user-auth, payment-capture）
- **change-id**：kebab-case，动词开头（add-two-factor-auth）
- 确保唯一性，重复时追加 -2、-3 等

---

## 🎓 总结

这份文档本质上是：**为 AI 助手规定如何使用 OpenSpec 框架来进行规范驱动的开发**。主要强调：

1. **三阶段流程**：提案 → 实现 → 归档
2. **严格的格式规范**：确保工具能正确解析
3. **审批门控**：必须先通过提案批准才能编码
4. **版本追踪**：所有变更都被跟踪和归档

tl ;dr是啥意思

---

_**Agent (model gemini-3-flash, mode Ask)**_

**TL;DR** 是一个网络缩写，意思是：

**T**oo **L**ong; **D**idn't **R**ead

**中文翻译**："太长了，懒得看" 或 "长话短说"

**用法**：
- 用在很长的文章、代码或文档前面
- 后面跟一个**超短的总结版本**，方便急匆匆的人快速了解核心内容
- 表示"如果你没时间读全文，就看这个简短版本吧"

**例子**：

在 `openspec/AGENTS.md` 文件里，**TL;DR Quick Checklist** 就是说：
- 🚀 **如果你没时间读整个457行的文档**
- 📋 **就看这个快速检查清单**（5-10行）
- ✅ **快速了解核心步骤**

类似的还有：
- **TL;DR** - 太长不读
- **TLDR** - 同上（无分号版本）
- **tl;dr** - 小写版本

---

_**Agent (model gemini-3-flash, mode Ask)**_

我来为你解释这个 Scenario 的含义。

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/liuhe/workspace/scripts/picture-book-creator/openspec/changes/add-image-quality-filter/specs/image-quality-filter/spec.md</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

好的，我来详细解释这段 Scenario 的含义。

---

## 📖 Scenario 完整解释

### **Scenario 是什么？**

**Scenario（场景）** 是在规范中描述一个**具体的使用情况**，用来说明系统在某个特定条件下应该如何表现。

它用 **WHEN-THEN-AND** 格式来表示一个"if-then"的逻辑流程。

---

## 🔍 这个 Scenario 的逐行解析

```
#### Scenario: 过滤转场图片
```
**这个场景的名字**：描述场景的目的（过滤低质量的转场图片）

---

### **WHEN（当...的时候）**

```
- **WHEN** 提取的帧清晰度低于阈值
```

**中文意思**：当系统提取的视频帧的清晰度评分**低于**设定的阈值时

**举例**：
- 清晰度阈值设为 100
- 提取的帧清晰度评分是 50（太模糊了）
- 50 < 100 → 触发这个场景

---

### **THEN（那么...）**

```
- **THEN** 系统跳过保存该帧
```

**中文意思**：系统应该**直接丢弃**这一帧，不保存成图片

**实际行为**：不生成 frame_0001.png、frame_0002.png 等

---

### **AND（并且...）**

```
- **AND** 不将该帧计入已保存数量
- **AND** 记录为质量过滤数量
```

**中文意思**：并且还要做这两件事：

1. **不计入已保存数量**
   - 假设你要保留 10 张图片
   - 提取了 50 帧，其中有 40 帧因为模糊被过滤了
   - 最终只保存了 10 张清晰的图片
   - 这 40 张被过滤的不计入"已保存数量"

2. **记录为质量过滤数量**
   - 系统要记录下有多少帧因为清晰度不足被丢弃了
   - 这样用户可以看到"有 40 张图片因为质量不好被过滤掉了"

---

## 📊 完整场景的逻辑流程

```
IF 清晰度低于阈值
  THEN
    ✓ 不保存该帧
    ✓ 不计入已保存数量
    ✓ 记录为被过滤掉的数量
```

---

## 🎯 对比其他 Scenario 来理解

你可以看这个**保留高质量有文字图片**的场景（第18-22行）：

```
#### Scenario: 保留高质量有文字图片
- **WHEN** 提取的帧清晰度达到阈值
- **AND** 帧中检测到文字
- **THEN** 系统保存该帧
- **AND** 计入已保存数量
```

**对比说明**：
- **第一个场景（第6-10行）**：清晰度低 → 丢弃
- **第三个场景（第18-22行）**：清晰度高 + 有文字 → 保存

它们是**互补的逻辑**。

---

## 💡 WHEN-THEN-AND 的标准格式

这是 BDD（行为驱动开发）的标准格式：

| 关键字 | 含义 | 作用 |
|-------|------|------|
| **WHEN** | "当...的时候" | 触发条件 |
| **THEN** | "那么..." | 主要行为 |
| **AND** | "并且..." | 额外的行为或预期结果 |

**好处**：
- ✅ 非常清晰，非技术人员也能理解
- ✅ 容易被自动化测试框架解析
- ✅ 避免歧义和误解

---

## 🔗 映射到真实代码

在 `video_to_images.py` 中，这个 Scenario 对应的代码是：

```python
# WHEN 清晰度低于阈值
quality_ok = check_image_sharpness(frame, sharpness_threshold)

if not quality_ok:  # 清晰度低
    # THEN 系统跳过保存
    quality_filtered += 1  # AND 记录为质量过滤数量
    # （AND 不将该帧计入已保存数量：通过 not 保存 frame 来实现）
```

## 📖 "过滤无文字图片" Scenario 解析

### **场景名称**
```
#### Scenario: 过滤无文字图片
```
**含义**：描述系统如何处理那些**没有包含任何文字**的图片

---

## 🔍 逐行解释

### **WHEN（当...时）**
```
- **WHEN** 提取的帧中未检测到文字
```

**中文意思**：当系统用 OCR（光学字符识别）扫描视频帧，**没有找到任何文字**时

**实际例子**：
- 视频截图是一张**纯风景照**（只有山和水，没有字）
- 或者是**纯色背景**没有任何文本
- OCR 扫描结果为空 → 触发这个场景

---

### **THEN（那么...）**
```
- **THEN** 系统跳过保存该帧
```

**中文意思**：系统**丢弃这一帧**，不保存成 PNG 图片文件

**为什么？** 因为项目的需求是"只保留包含文字的图片"（比如提取 PPT、有字幕的视频等）

---

### **AND（并且...）**

#### **第一个 AND**
```
- **AND** 不将该帧计入已保存数量
```

**中文意思**：这张图片被丢弃了，所以**不算作最终保存的图片数**

**举例**：
- 提取了 100 帧
- 其中 60 帧没有文字
- 这 60 帧被过滤掉
- 最终只保存了 40 张有文字的图片
- 成功数 = 40（不包括那 60 张）

#### **第二个 AND**
```
- **AND** 记录为文字过滤数量
```

**中文意思**：系统要**统计和记录**有多少张图片因为没有文字而被过滤掉

**用途**：用户可以在结果中看到：
```
转换完成:
  总帧数: 100
  保存图片: 40
  文字过滤: 60  ← 因为没有文字被丢弃的数量
  质量过滤: 0
```

---

## 🎯 整个场景的完整逻辑

```
IF 帧中没有检测到文字
  THEN
    ✓ 不保存这一帧（不生成 PNG 文件）
    ✓ 不计入已保存图片数
    ✓ 累计到"文字过滤数量"
```

---

## 🔗 与前一个 Scenario 的对比

| Scenario | 触发条件 | 行为 |
|----------|---------|------|
| **过滤转场图片** | 清晰度低 | 丢弃 + 记录为"质量过滤" |
| **过滤无文字图片** | 没有文字 | 丢弃 + 记录为"文字过滤" |

**都是丢弃，但原因和统计类别不同**

---

## 💻 代码对应

在 `video_to_images.py` 中：

```python
# WHEN 检测文字
if require_text:
    has_text_content = has_text(frame, text_lang)  # OCR 扫描
    
    if not has_text_content:  # 没有检测到文字
        # THEN 丢弃该帧
        text_filtered += 1  # AND 记录为文字过滤数量
        # （AND 不计入已保存数量：通过不调用 cv2.imwrite() 实现）
```

---

## 📊 实际场景例子

假设你上传一个 PPT 录屏视频：

1. **第 1-30 秒**：PPT 标题页面（有文字 ✓）
   - 清晰度好 ✓
   - 有文字 ✓
   - → **保存** ✅

2. **第 31-45 秒**：转场动画（渐变效果，无文字 ✗）
   - 清晰度好 ✓
   - 无文字 ✗
   - → **丢弃**（文字过滤）❌

3. **第 46-60 秒**：内容页面有文字但模糊（比如远景镜头）
   - 清晰度差 ✗
   - 有文字 ✓
   - → **丢弃**（质量过滤）❌

最终结果：
```
总帧数: 300
保存图片: 50  (只有清晰且有文字的)
质量过滤: 80  (有文字但模糊)
文字过滤: 170 (清晰但无文字)
```

## 📖 "保留高质量有文字图片" Scenario 解析

### **场景名称**
```
#### Scenario: 保留高质量有文字图片
```
**含义**：描述系统在什么条件下**应该保存**一张图片（与前两个"过滤"场景相反）

---

## 🔍 逐行解释

### **WHEN（当...时）- 第一个条件**
```
- **WHEN** 提取的帧清晰度达到阈值
```

**中文意思**：当视频帧的清晰度评分**≥ 阈值**时

**举例**：
- 清晰度阈值设为 100
- 提取的帧清晰度评分是 120
- 120 ≥ 100 → 清晰度合格 ✓

---

### **AND（并且...）- 第二个条件**
```
- **AND** 帧中检测到文字
```

**中文意思**：**并且**这一帧中**存在文字**（OCR 能识别到字）

**举例**：
- 这是 PPT 演讲稿的一页
- 上面有标题、内容等文字
- OCR 扫描成功检测到文字 ✓

---

### **THEN（那么...）- 主要行为**
```
- **THEN** 系统保存该帧
```

**中文意思**：系统**保存这一帧**，生成 PNG 图片文件

**具体动作**：
- 创建文件 `frame_0001.png`、`frame_0002.png` 等
- 将帧数据写入磁盘
- 存储到输出目录

---

### **AND（并且...）- 额外行为**
```
- **AND** 计入已保存数量
```

**中文意思**：这张成功保存的图片要**计入总数**

**举例**：
- 提取了 100 帧
- 最终有 40 帧满足条件（清晰 + 有文字）
- 已保存数量 = 40 ✓

---

## 🎯 整个场景的完整逻辑

```
IF 清晰度 ≥ 阈值 AND 有文字
  THEN
    ✓ 保存这一帧为 PNG 文件
    ✓ 计入已保存图片数
```

---

## 🔄 三个 Scenario 的完整流程图

```
提取一帧画面
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 检查清晰度是否 ≥ 阈值？          │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
    ↙ 否                    ↘ 是
过滤转场图片            检查是否有文字？
(丢弃)                  ↙ 否              ↘ 是
质量过滤+1    过滤无文字图片    保留高质量有文字图片
              (丢弃)           (保存)
              文字过滤+1       已保存数+1
```

---

## 💻 代码对应

在 `video_to_images.py` 中（第127-146行）：

```python
if not is_similar:  # 不重复
    quality_ok = check_image_sharpness(frame, sharpness_threshold)
    
    if not quality_ok:  # 清晰度不足 → 过滤转场图片
        quality_filtered += 1
    else:  # 清晰度合格 ✓
        has_text_content = True
        
        if require_text:
            has_text_content = has_text(frame, text_lang)  # 检查有无文字
            
            if not has_text_content:  # 没有文字 → 过滤无文字图片
                text_filtered += 1
        
        if has_text_content:  # 清晰 + 有文字 → 保留高质量有文字图片
            filename = output_dir / f"frame_{saved_count + 1:04d}.png"
            cv2.imwrite(str(filename), frame)  # 保存
            saved_frames.append(frame.copy())
            saved_count += 1  # 计入已保存数量
```

---

## 📊 实际例子

假设你的 PPT 录屏视频：

| 帧 | 清晰度 | 有文字？ | 清晰度 ≥ 100？ | 有文字？ | 结果 |
|----|--------|---------|---------------|---------|------|
| 第1帧 | 150 | ✓ | **是** | **是** | ✅ **保存** |
| 第2帧 | 80 | ✓ | **否** | 是 | ❌ 过滤（质量） |
| 第3帧 | 120 | ✗ | **是** | **否** | ❌ 过滤（文字） |
| 第4帧 | 110 | ✓ | **是** | **是** | ✅ **保存** |

---

## 🎯 总结对比

| 场景 | 清晰度 | 文字 | 结果 | 统计 |
|------|--------|------|------|------|
| **过滤转场图片** | ❌ 低 | ✓ 有 | 丢弃 | 质量过滤 |
| **过滤无文字图片** | ✓ 高 | ❌ 无 | 丢弃 | 文字过滤 |
| **保留高质量有文字** | ✓ 高 | ✓ 有 | 🎉 **保存** | 已保存数 |

**这个场景是最理想的情况**，两个条件都满足，所以图片被保存。

## 💡 拼音声调说明

- **第一声 (ā)** - 高平音，读音保持高
- **第二声 (á)** - 上升音，从中低升到高
- **第三声 (ǎ)** - 下降升高音，先降后升
- **第四声 (à)** - 下降音，从高降到低

这样你就可以用标准汉语拼音来读英文单词了！

Specification	/ˌspesɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/	sī pài xī fēi kāi shēn 这个拼音感觉不对

---

_**Agent (model gemini-3-flash, mode Ask)**_

你说得对！我重新为这个单词标注正确的拼音：

**Specification** /ˌspesɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/

正确的拼音应该是：**sī pè sī fī kāi shēn**

或者更接近英文发音的拼音：**spè si fi kāi shən**

---

让我为你解释这个单词的音节划分：

| 音节 | 音标 | 拼音 |
|-----|------|------|
| **spec** | /spek/ | sī pè kè |
| **i** | /ɪ/ | fī |
| **fi** | /fɪ/ | fī |
| **ca** | /keɪ/ | kāi |
| **tion** | /ʃən/ | shēn |

完整组合：**spè sī fī kāi shēn** 或 **sī pè sī fī kāi shēn**

Scenario 是不是瑟.奶瑞奥

---

_**Agent (model gemini-3-flash, mode Ask)**_

你说得对！**Scenario** 的美音发音更接近：

**瑟·奶瑞奥** /səˈnɛrioʊ/

让我为你纠正：

| 音节 | 音标 | 中文谐音 |
|-----|------|---------|
| **sce** | /sə/ | 瑟 |
| **nar** | /ˈnɛr/ | 奶 |
| **i** | /i/ | 瑞 |
| **o** | /oʊ/ | 奥 |

完整发音：**瑟·奶瑞·奥** 或简写 **瑟·奶瑞奥**

感谢你的纠正！这个更准确。我之前的"瑟·尼瑞欧"确实不够准确。

你如果发现表格中还有其他不准确的地方，也可以继续指正，我会逐一改进！

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Defining the Parameters**

I'm now focusing on the specific parameters for the error-corrected OpenSpec word list. American English is the target dialect, as requested. I'm also confirming the required format: English word, American IPA pronunciation, and Chinese transliteration. This will streamline the data collection process.


**Evaluating Phonetics & Terms**

I'm now carefully reviewing the user's preferred Chinese transliterations for key terms. I'm focusing on "Scenario," "Requirement," and "Specification," ensuring the updated suggestions reflect the user's expectations for phonetic accuracy and natural flow in Chinese. I'm also planning to create a refined pronunciation guide, as a reference for the subsequent terms.


**Expanding & Refining the List**

I've significantly expanded the list of OpenSpec terms to include a wider range of vocabulary. I'm focusing on ensuring the accuracy of the phonetic transliterations, as well as considering how the syllables match up with Mandarin sounds. The goal is to capture the user's intent with the user's preferred terms, like "Scenario" and "Specification." I'm also including the Chinese meaning for each term.


**Updating the Word List**

I've just added several more OpenSpec terms to the list, with IPA pronunciations, and Chinese transliterations, with focus on accurate representation of American English. I’m focusing on matching the syllables with Mandarin sounds. I have also added Chinese meanings to help with comprehension. This is following the user’s requests.

## 💡 重点勘误说明：

1.  **Scenario**: 之前版本标为“瑟·尼瑞欧”，现纠正为**“瑟·奶瑞奥”**。美音中 `a` 发 `/ɛ/` 音，更接近“奶”；结尾 `/oʊ/` 更接近“奥”。
2.  **Requirement**: 之前标为“瑞·夸亚蒙特”，现改为**“瑞·阔瓦尔·梦特”**。美音中 `quire` 包含卷舌音 `/r/`，发音更像“阔瓦尔”。
3.  **Specification**: 之前标为“斯佩·塞弗”，现改为**“斯派·瑟·费”**。美音第一音节 `spe` 读音更脆，接近“斯派”。
4.  **Proposal**: 之前标为“普若·坡兹尔”，现改为**“普若·剖·走”**。美音 `po` 发长音 `/oʊ/`，结尾 `/zəl/` 读音很轻，接近“走”。
5.  **Performance**: 之前标为“帕·佛·蒙斯”，现改为**“普·佛·门斯”**。美音开头 `per` 卷舌感强，更接近“普”。

这一版发音会让你听起来更像地道的美式口音！如果还有哪个单词读起来拗口，随时告诉我。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Considering the Implications**

I'm focused on the implications of removing the "Chinese transliteration/homophone" column from the OpenSpec vocabulary list. It's becoming clear that this change simplifies the list, making it less cluttered. The list will be cleaner, easier to parse, but the information it offers will become less rich. I'm weighing the value of brevity against the loss of linguistic depth.


**Weighing the Trade-offs**

I'm now contemplating the impact of the column's removal on search functionality. Without the transliteration, searching for terms using Chinese phonetic similarity becomes impossible. This limitation affects discovery, and makes identifying related concepts more challenging. I am still considering if the gains in clarity outweigh the losses in discoverability and depth.


**Revisiting the Objectives**

Now I am reevaluating the user's ultimate aim. It appears the core request is a straightforward list with specific columns. Removing the Chinese homophone column simplifies the process and the final table structure. However, I need to ensure the most crucial information is retained, even if some nuance is lost.


**Focusing on the Final Format**

I'm now zeroing in on the final table structure. The user's goal of a simplified, three-column table (English word, US IPA, Chinese meaning) is clear. I'm prioritizing direct presentation of the data, as requested, without the extraneous column. I'm mentally arranging the information to ensure clarity and conciseness.
